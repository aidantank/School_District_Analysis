# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Create a detailed report for the school board regarding math and reading scores based on grade, school spending, school size, and school type. Furthermore, there is suspicion of academic dishonesty for the reading and match scores from Thomas High School ninth graders. Create the same report of reading and math scores, but remove math and reading scores from Thomas High School 9th graders, then determine how the two reports difer if at all.
